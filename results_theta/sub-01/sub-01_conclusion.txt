ANALYSIS CONCLUSION: sub-01 - THETA BAND (4-8 Hz)
================================================================================

OVERALL FINDINGS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Found 3 significant clusters across 3/15 channels
• 0.19% of timepoints show significant differences
• Effect directions:
  - Speech > Music: 1 clusters
  - Music > Speech: 2 clusters

PRIMARY FINDING:
• Music stimuli elicit stronger theta power than speech
• This suggests enhanced neural oscillatory activity in response to music

STRONGEST EFFECTS (Top 3 Channels):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. AR7: Music > Speech
   Mean t-statistic: -5.53, Cluster size: 11 timepoints
2. ITR9: Speech > Music
   Mean t-statistic: 3.14, Cluster size: 19 timepoints
3. AHL8: Music > Speech
   Mean t-statistic: -2.89, Cluster size: 24 timepoints

INTERPRETATION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) are associated with:
  - Working memory and cognitive control
  - Temporal encoding of speech segments
  - Auditory processing and attention
• The observed differences suggest condition-specific theta modulation
  in language/auditory processing regions (perisylvian cortex)

NEXT STEPS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Review detailed cluster report: sub-01_cluster_report.txt
• Examine visualizations: sub-01_summary_cluster-based.png
• Compare with other subjects for group-level patterns
• Use roi_group_analysis.py for ROI-specific group statistics
